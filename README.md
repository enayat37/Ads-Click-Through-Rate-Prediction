# Ads-Click-Through-Rate-Prediction

Ads Click Through Rate is the ratio of how many users clicked on your ad to how many users viewed your ad. For example, 5 out of 100 users click on the ad while watching a youtube video. So, in this case, the CTR of the youtube ad will be 5%. Analyzing the click-through rate help companies in finding the best ad for their target audience.
Ads Click-through rate prediction means predicting whether the user will click on the ad. In the task of ads click-through rate prediction, we need to train a Machine Learning model to find relationships between the characteristics of all the users who click on ads.
In summary, this is how you can use Machine Learning for the task of Ads CTR prediction using Python. Ads CTR means predicting whether the user will click on the ad. In this task, we need to train a Machine Learning model to find relationships between the characteristics of all the users who click on ads.
